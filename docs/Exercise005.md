# Exercise 005

This exercise gives you the opportunity to explore pattern-matching.

### Instructions

A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the alphabet at least once.

`"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"` is an example of a pangram.

Your challenge is to write a program that determines if a sentence is a pangram.

You can assume that:

-   The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters `a` to `z`
-   Your program accepts input for both upper and lower cases
-   The input will not contain non-ASCII characters/symbols

### Add additional unit tests

You'll see some starter unit tests in [Exercise005Tests.cs](../Exercises.Tests/Exercise005Tests.cs)
Your job is to add additional unit tests and make all the unit tests pass.

Feel free to structure your code however you prefer to solve the exercise.
We'd like to see clean code, so please keep clear separation of concerns, and the D.R.Y. (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle in mind.

### Once you're done

🥳 Good job! Spend some time cleaning and polishing your code, and then submit it via Google Classroom.

Thank you!
